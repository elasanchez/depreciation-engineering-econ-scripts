# depreciation-engineering-econ-scripts
I created these scripts to double check my engineering economics homework on four standard depreciation methods:
###`Straight-Line, Sum-Of-Years-Digit (SOYD)`

##### `Double Declining Balance (DDB)`
 
 `and Modified Accelerated` 
 
 `Cost Recovery System (MACRS)` for Non-residential property
